BBC Ontologies
==============

The BBC did a lot of good work with RDF back in the day, but this has
slowly fallen into disrepair over time. I'm archiving the original
TTL files, downloaded from the BBC website (under a CC-BY 4.0 license),
in this repository, in the increasingly likely event that they
disappear completely one day.
