BBC Ontologies
==============

The BBC did a lot of good work with RDF back in the day, but this has
slowly fallen into disrepair over time. The programme data has already
been removed -- I've managed to keep a copy of the data for Doctor Who
[here](https://github.com/ads04r/doctor-who-rdf) -- and the purl.org
URIs for the ontologies no longer resolve. For this reason, I'm archiving
the original TTL versions of the various ontologies that the BBC used,
downloaded from the BBC website, where they were originally released
under a CC-BY 4.0 license.
